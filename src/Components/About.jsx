          Hello, I'm Sameer Pathan, a passionate Frontend Developer with two
          years of professional experience in the field. I'm currently part of
          the dynamic team at Mphasis, where I've honed my skills and crafted
          user-friendly web experiences. My journey in the tech world began with
          a degree in Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering, which I
          completed in 2021. Following my education, I embarked on an enriching
          internship at Newton School, further cementing my love for frontend
          development.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p className="text-xl ">
          My long-term aspiration is to evolve into a Frontend Architect, where
          I can shape the future of web applications and user interfaces. My
          short-term goal, however, is to continue perfecting my craft as a
          proficient Frontend Developer. I thrive on the challenges of creating
          aesthetically pleasing and highly functional websites, and I'm
          dedicated to staying updated with the latest technologies and best
          practices in the ever-evolving world of frontend development. With a
          blend of creativity, technical prowess, and a commitment to
          excellence, I aim to leave a meaningful mark on the digital landscape.
          Feel free to adjust and personalize these paragraphs as needed to best
          represent your unique background and aspirations.
